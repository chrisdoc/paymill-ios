## Using the payment screens


### Installation


To use the payment screens you need to copy the whole `PaymentScreens` directory into your project.

You should make sure that all included images are added to your project's `Bundle Resources`.


### Styling the payment screens
If you like the layout of the payment screens and you simply want to change the colors, you can set them using the [PMStyle](http://paymill.github.io/paymill-ios/docs/sdk/Classes/PMStyle.html) class.

### Work with the Payment View Controller


API Docs for the Payment View Controller are available [here](http://paymill.github.io/paymill-ios/docs/sdk/) .

- Create the `PMPaymentParams` object that describes the amount, currency and description. Note, that you need to specify one, even if only generate a token.

```objective-c
NSError *error;
PMPaymentParams *pmParams = [PMFactory genPaymentParamsWithCurrency:@"EUR" amount:100 description:@"Description" error:&error];  
```

- Create and configure a [PMSettings](http://paymill.github.io/paymill-ios/docs/sdk/Classes/PMSettings.html) object.

```objective-c
//set payment view settings
PMSettings pmSettings= [[PMSettings alloc] init];
pmSettings.paymentType = TOKEN;
pmSettings.cardTypes = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"American Express", @"Visa", nil];//switch on American Expres and Visa
pmSettings.directDebitCountry = @"DE"; //switch on direct debit for Germany
pmSettings.isTestMode = YES;
pmSettings.consumable = YES;
```
- Call the [PMPaymentViewController](http://paymill.github.io/paymill-ios/docs/sdk/Classes/PMPaymentViewController.html) designated initializer to create it.

```objective-c
id paymentViewController = [PMPaymentViewController alloc] initWithParams:pmParams publicKey:publicKey settings:pmSetings style:pmStyle 
			success:^(id) {
			//handle success
			} failure:^(NSError *) {
			//handle error
			}];
```
- Push or present the view controller modally. 


Complete example:

```objective-c
-(void)test {
   //create payment params	 
   NSError *error;
   PMPaymentParams *pmParams = [PMFactory genPaymentParamsWithCurrency:@"EUR" amount:100 description:@"Description" error:&error];
   //create payment settings
   PMSettings pmSettings= [[PMSettings alloc] init];
   pmSettings.paymentType = TOKEN;
   pmSettings.cardTypes = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"American Express", @"Visa", nil];//switch on American Expres and Visa
   pmSettings.directDebitCountry = @"DE"; //switch on direct debit for Germany
   pmSettings.isTestMode = YES;
   pmSettings.consumable = YES;
   //create the payment view controller
   id paymentViewController = [PMPaymentViewController alloc] initWithParams:pmParams publicKey:publicKey settings:pmSetings style:pmStyle 
			success:^(id resObject) {
			   //handle success
			   //since the payment type set in the settings is TOKEN, we expect a NSString to come back from PAYMILL
		           token =  (NSString*)resObject;		
			} failure:^(NSError *) {
			   //handle error
			}];
   //present the view controller modally				
   [self presentViewController:paymentViewController animated:YES completion:nil];
}
```
